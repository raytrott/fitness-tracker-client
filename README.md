# PeakFit - Track your workouts, reach peak fitness!

This is the frontend repo for my full stack fitness tracker application, PeakFit! With PeakFit, one can log their workout by date, type, and exercises performed.

For this full-stack project assignment from General Assembly, I decided to create a fitness tracker. In my personal life, not only do I love staying active, but I'm especially passionate about tracking my workouts so that I have metrics to assess my performance and can continue to progress toward my goals over time. This app is an extension of that passion and I hope to continue developing and expanding its features in the future.
